# Hospital Bed Availability and Oxygen Cylinder Monitoring Interface

## Objectives of the Work Undertaken

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a Hospital Bed Availability and Oxygen Cylinder Monitoring Interface using a design thinking approach. This system aims to provide real-time information on bed availability and oxygen cylinder status to enhance hospital efficiency and patient care.

Specific objectives include:

- Identifying user needs through empathy and research, focusing on the frustrations of doctors with manual bed checks and nurses with oxygen tracking.
- Defining problems in resource management, such as delays in patient care due to inefficient allocation.
- Ideating solutions for monitoring, incorporating color-coded displays and alerts for low levels.
- Prototyping and testing the interface to ensure usability and effectiveness.
- Planning implementation and future improvements, including integration with HER systems.

Applying design thinking to healthcare could enhance innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness by increasing focus on patient and provider needs. This project aligns with these goals by addressing real-world challenges in hospital resource management.

## Scope of the Work

- Development of a web-based application for hospital staff, including doctors, nurses, and administrators.
- Covers bed management across departments like ICU and Emergency, and oxygen monitoring with alerts.
- Limited to prototype development and testing, with recommendations for full deployment.
- Does not include hardware integration but suggests IoT for future enhancements, such as sensors for real-time oxygen levels.
- Aims to integrate with existing EMR systems for seamless data exchange.

The scope also extends to underserved populations, where design thinking proves useful in tailoring interventions to user needs. For instance, in rural areas with limited resources, this interface could optimize bed and oxygen usage.
